1.At a particular company, employees are rated at the end of each year. The rating scale begins at 0.0, with higher values indicating better performance and resulting in larger raises. The value awarded to an employee is either 0.0, 0.4, or 0.6 or more. Values between 0.0 and 0.4, and between 0.4 and 0.6 are never used. The meaning associated with each rating is shown in the following table. The amount of an employeeâ€™s raise is $2,400.00 multiplied by their rating.
